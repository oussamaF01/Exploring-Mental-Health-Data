# Kaggle Competition Submission: Exploring Mental Health Data 🧠💡

This repository contains my solutions and work for the Kaggle competition titled **Exploring Mental Health Data**. The project aims to explore mental health conditions and predict them using Logistic Regression, focusing on data processing and analysis. 🧪📊

## Overview 🌟

- **Competition Name**: Exploring Mental Health Data
- **Objective**: Analyze and predict mental health conditions based on the available dataset. This includes understanding various factors influencing mental health and predicting the likelihood of mental health conditions.
- **Dataset**: Includes features such as demographic information, symptoms, and survey responses. The data combines categorical, numerical, and textual variables.


## Key Features ⚙️

### 1. Data Processing & Preprocessing 🔍
- **Handling Missing Data**: Applied methods to handle missing values by either filling or removing them based on the context.
- **Categorical Variable Encoding**: Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding to make them usable for machine learning models.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalized numerical features to improve the performance of the logistic regression model.

### 2. Logistic Regression Model 🧮
- Used **Logistic Regression** to predict the likelihood of mental health conditions based on the features available in the dataset.
- The model was trained and tuned to ensure optimal performance using cross-validation.

### 3. Model Evaluation 📈
- Evaluated the Logistic Regression model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
